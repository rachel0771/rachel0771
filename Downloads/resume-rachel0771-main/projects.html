            <h2>Pet Info</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Pet Info</strong> is a personal project that I developed using the Pug templating engine. It serves as a comprehensive pet information registration and query system.
            </p>
            <p>
                The application allows users to register details like their pets' names, select breeds, and record their pets' preferences. This functionality is particularly useful for pet owners who need to keep track of various aspects of their pet care.
            </p>
            <p>
                The app connects to MongoDB, ensuring efficient data management and storage. Its intuitive interface design makes it a convenient and efficient platform for managing pet information.

            <h2>Bubble Tea Review</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Bubble Tea Review</strong> is a group project where we focused on creating a platform for reviewing Happy Lemon bubble tea beverages. The project was developed to emphasize user interaction and feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
                It features a user-friendly interface where customers can log in via IAP to rate and review teas. Users can also view comments based on specific tea categories, making it easy to find reviews of particular interest.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, the project utilizes advanced data analysis techniques. This provides users with personalized recommendations, enhancing the user experience and fostering a more engaged community.
